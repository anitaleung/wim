					<h2>So what's myopia?</h2>
					<div class="pwrap">
						<p>Well, I’m glad you asked.</p>
						<p>“Myopia” is the scientific twin of “nearsightedness.” Someone who’s nearsighted can see near objects clearly while farther objects appear blurry.</p>
						<p>People who are nearsighted have longer eyeballs than normal, whereas people who are hyperopic, or farsighted, have shorter eyeballs than normal.</p>

					<p>As a baby, everyone is farsighted, and no group is more farsighted than another.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>At birth, the eyeball is about 17 millimeters long</li>
						<li>For the next three years, the eyeball quickly grows to about 23 mm</li>
						<li>From age three to thirteen, the eye slowly elongates just a little from exposure to closework</li>
						<li>The eyeball should reach to about 24 mm by adulthood</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Many farsighted children simply outgrow farsightedness.</p>

					<h2 >Okay, what about nearsightedness?</h2>
					<div class="pwrap">
						<p>If the eye repeatedly stares at close objects for a long, long time, the cilliary muscle surrounding the lens undergoes a spasm. When this happens, the ciliary muscle lock up into a contracted state, stretching the choroid. When stetched long enough, the choroid, a layer in the eyeball wall, becomes thinner and larger. This extra space in the vitreous chamber is then filled with watery liquid created from a gland in the anterior chamber.</p>
						<p>There’s no way to shrink the eye back ot its orginal size. Once the eye has officially changed sizes, it has changed sizes. The only way to have 20/20 vision again would be through surgery.</p>

					<h2>Wait, wait, wait. But how does the lens bend light?</h2>
					<div class="pwrap">
						<p>Remember when you were little and wondered why a straw looks bent in a glass of water? No? Okay, read this.</p>
						<p>Imagine a straight line of people running across a river. Maybe they’re the most hardcore marathon runners you’ve ever seen. When the first few runners start entering the riverbank, they slow down since water has more density than air. In other words, there’s more “stuff” to struggle through. As a person runs from land into the water and slows down, the guy behind that person catches up a little. Ultimately, the distance between each person in the river is shorter than the distance between each person on land. When the first few people start to reach the other side of the river, the ones treading out of water will speed up again.</p>
						<p>Great, now we understand that light travels slower and in shorter wavelenghts in water or glass than in air. But what about that part where light bends?</p>
